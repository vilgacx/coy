### Disclaimer
**I have zero clue about making a programming languages or compiler design â€“ never learned any of that stuff. One morning I just woke up with a hackathon in 2 hours and no idea what to build. So I just thought I "let's make a programing language". I had keep it web based as cause it was a web-focused hackathon. I was given 6 hours and made it's initial version in those hours. I am continunig this after my hackathon cause why not. This project is more of a experiment on my existing skills, problem solving abilities and how much I can push my boundaries.**
